# ApplAI Final Project

 ### This is a Customer Segmentation project.
  **Problem Statement**: Owners of a mall want to segment their customers based on the data they have collected about them, the data is located in the CSV "Mall_Customers.csv" file.

 In the Notebook file you can find all steps I have taken to deal with the data, first the pre-processing then data representation, then I proceed with my assumptions and try out different models to check their efficiency, through out the notebook you will find the Comment blocks explaining my thought process, assumptions and conclusions. The code is also commented for ease of readability.

 The clustered data is then deployed on a website using streamlit library, the data is not depoleyed in a form of a dashboard due to lack features and possible analytics, after approval of my mentor I depolyed it in form submission manner, where you populate a form simulating a customer, and you will be assigned to the proper cluster, interactive plots are available on the site.

 To try the website download both the "Classifier.py" and the "Customer_Segmentation_model" and the install the required dependencies in the Python file, run the Python file using streamlit and test it out.
